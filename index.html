		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>
		<div>
		My name is Royce, I live in Bendigo Victoria. After many years slugging away in the trades and security I went after a career change and was lucky enough to find work in the events sector providing WiFi, 
		</div>
		networking and tech solutions for festivals, corporate brand activations and expo's.
		</p>
		<p>
		My aim in this course is to further develop my knowledge around IT, and find new ways to implement technology into the events space.
		</p>
		My current IT skill-set is very network orientated with basic knowledge of IP protocols. 
		<div>
		I have no experience with code / programing or web development and this is the area I find most daunting and exciting.
		</div>
		 I have a fairly firm grasp of 3Dcad software and have had training in Vectorworks, I am currently in the process of teaching myself Fusion 360.
		</p>
		<p>
		My hobbies include Guitar, Gaming, Drafting / 3D modeling, 3D printing, Woodworking and fabrication (I guess I would fall into the hobbyist / maker category).
		</p>
		
		<h2>Interest in IT</h2>
		<p>
		<div>
		Computers and IT have always been a part of my life, I started gaming at 11 and by the time internet was good enough for video streaming
		</div>
		I have used it to learn from things like YouTube. It is only recently I have considered IT in a professional sense and am really excited to see where it takes me!
		</p>
		<p>
		<div>
		I chose RMIT because it has a reputation of being a leader in education and technology which I really value.
		</div>
		<div>
		I hope to learn all the skills I will need to start a long & rewarding career in IT.
