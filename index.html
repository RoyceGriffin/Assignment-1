		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>
		<div>
		My name is Royce, I live in Bendigo Victoria. After many years slugging away in the trades and security I went after a career change and was lucky enough to find work in the events sector providing WiFi, 
		</div>
		networking and tech solutions for festivals, corporate brand activations and expo's.
		</p>
		<p>
		My aim in this course is to further develop my knowledge around IT, and find new ways to implement technology into the events space.
		</p>
		My current IT skill-set is very network orientated with basic knowledge of IP protocols. 
		<div>
		I have no experience with code / programing or web development and this is the area I find most daunting and exciting.
		</div>
		 I have a fairly firm grasp of 3Dcad software and have had training in Vectorworks, I am currently in the process of teaching myself Fusion 360.
		</p>
		<p>
		My hobbies include Guitar, Gaming, Drafting / 3D modeling, 3D printing, Woodworking and fabrication (I guess I would fall into the hobbyist / maker category).
		</p>
		
		<h2>Interest in IT</h2>
		<p>
		<div>
		Computers and IT have always been a part of my life, I started gaming at 11 (I'm 29 now) and by the time internet was good enough for video streaming
		</div>
		I have used it to learn from things like YouTube. It is only recently I have considered IT in a professional sense and am really excited to see where it takes me!
		</p>
		<p>
		<div>
		I chose RMIT because it has a reputation of being a leader in education and technology which I really value.
		</div>
		<div>
		I hope to learn all the skills I will need to start a long & rewarding career in IT.
		</div>
		</p>
		<h2>Ideal Job</h2>
		<p>
		<div>
		Although I am lucky and work in what I would describe as my ideal job, down the road I would love to work in development of software.
		</div>
		something like this would be ideal.
		<div>
		<img src="JobAd.png">
		</div>
		</p>
		<p>
		<div>
		This position entails management of a team to provide projects on a deadline, correspond with clients & stakeholders, and
</div>
		<div>
		have a good base of knowledge on development of programs. This appeals because it combines high technical knowledge in a team based work environment. 
		</div>
		<div>
		Skills and experience I will need to develop include programming and development of systems, and a few years in app development.
		</div>
		<div>
		I do well in a professional environment managing clients and meeting deadlines, so the technical experience and skills would be my focus.
</div>
		<div>
		My plan is to finish this course and work closely with the app developers at my current job to learn their approach.

		<h2>Project: EFRS</h2>

<h3>Economic Facial Recognition System</h3>

<h4>Overview & Description</h4>
<p>
<div>
A problem we face while doing camera installations at festivals and other large events is if there is an incident at a gig
</div>
<div>
all of the footage from a 20+ cameras has to be manually searched using an NVR program like Milestone or GeoVision.
</div>
<div>
As this is a very time consuming process it would be a great help to be able to put a person of interests photo into a plugin
</div>
<div>
Program and have it show every frame that face shows up in order of the time stamp each frame has. this would be not only be
</div>
<div>
faster and less hands on it would create a difinitive timeline of events which is very important when it comes to investigations.
</div>
</p>
<p>
<div>
Facial recognition is not new or cutting edge but I believe it is a tool that should be more accessible to startups and small companies
</div>
<div>
who wish to use it to make safer work environments and collect data to further improve their efficiency.
</div>
</p>
<div>
Security is not the only application (pardon the pun) as there is a program we currently use at work that reads a face and gives feedback as to
</div>
<div>
The persons mood, disposition, tiredness, etc. This is excellent for passive feedback so you no longer have to send out surveys and
</div>
<div>
and pester clients for feedback as the customer satisfaction rate can be tracked and analysed unintrusively. As a bonus it would
</div>
<div>
piggyback right into the security camera system killing two birds with one stone.
</div>
<div>
The downsie is the cost, currently it is around $100 per month to have the software alone + hardware 
</div>
<div>
so for a startup or small business this technology is relatively price prohibitive.
</div>
<div>
My goal is to write a facial recognition program that could be utilised as a platform
</div>
<div>
for an all in one program that would ideally be user friendly, intuitive and flexible.
</div>
<h4>Skills Tools & Tech Required:</h4>
<div>
Programming, coding and app design, Knowledge of hardware and sofware compatibility / capability.
</div>
<div>
I believe there is an open source platfrom that does facial recognition so finding that as a base to build off
</div>
<div>
and then packaging it so it could be mobile or desktop compatible would be the overall goal.
</div>
<h4>Outcome:</h4>
<div>
The success of this project will be measured by a balance of cost, form factor, and functionality.
</div>
<div>
My hope is that it could be less than $200 total to purchase, able to run on machines as economical as a Raspberry Pi,
</div>
<div>
and be able to put together a timeline of video footage using an input photo & deliver statistical environment data
</div>
<div>
with parameters such as mood, happiness, energy, and satisfaction.
